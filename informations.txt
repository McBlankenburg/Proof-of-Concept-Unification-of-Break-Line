Apply the "clean" process freshly to all tracked files to forcibly add them again to the index.
This is useful after changing core.autocrlf configuration or the text attribute in order to correct files added with wrong CRLF/LF line endings.
This option implies -u. Lone CR characters are untouched, thus while a CRLF cleans to LF, a CRCRLF sequence is only partially cleaned to CRLF.

git add --renormalize .
(not working probably because mixed file with CRLF and LF, probably it working on files only in LF  with .gitattributes)
